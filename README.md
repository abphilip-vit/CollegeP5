We designed a model that offers much more reliable vehicle detection with less time required compared to other deep convolutional approaches. The device is designed to track vehicles in traffic through video surveillance. Unlike other convolutional neural network approaches that identify specified objects, the modified convolutional deep learning approach increases the accuracy of detecting ambulances.

Ambulance Detection using Image Processing and Neural Network is a vehicle detection and tracking system, which recognizes the vehicle (i.e. Ambulance in this case) amidst traffic congestion. Due to the fact from past few years, the range of vehicles usage of the road is growing each day that results in traffic congestion, for better management of this traffic this system is useful. The Ambulance tracking system is activated at the mapped junctions and that program detects the ambulance coming close to it and turns the traffic light to Green for the next 15 seconds.
